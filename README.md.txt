Program Description: ImageDuplicationChecker
ImageDuplicationChecker is a simple Python tool for comparing two images and determining whether they are duplicates based on the same pixel content. The program utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) to open and process the images, enabling a pixel-by-pixel comparison.

Key Features:
Duplicate Verification: The program compares two user-provided images and determines if they are identical in terms of pixel content.
Support for Various Image Formats: Through the PIL library, the program can process images in various common formats such as PNG, JPEG, BMP, among others.
User-Friendly: The command-line interface of the program allows for straightforward interaction with the user, prompting for image paths and providing a clear result.
How to Use:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the PIL (Python Imaging Library) by executing the following command: pip install pillow.
Download the program and run it from the command line using Python.
The program will prompt for the paths of the two images you wish to compare.
After providing the paths, the program will determine if the images are duplicates and display the result in the console.
Notes:
This program is a basic image comparison solution and will only detect exact duplicates in terms of pixel content.
For more advanced purposes or to detect similar images with slight variations, more sophisticated image processing techniques would be required.
